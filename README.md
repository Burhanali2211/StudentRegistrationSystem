# Student Grade Management System

This project is a Python-based system that allows managing student grades. It provides various functionalities to add, view, and calculate student grades, as well as find the highest and lowest grades in the class. It uses different Python data structures like lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples to efficiently store and manage the data.

## Features

1. **Add Student**: Allows the user to add a student along with their grades for multiple subjects.
2. **View Students**: Displays all the students with their corresponding grades for each subject.
3. **Calculate Average Grade**: Calculates the average grade for a specific student.
4. **Find Highest and Lowest Grades**: Displays the highest and lowest grades in the class.
5. **Remove Student**: Allows the user to remove a student from the system.

## Data Structures Used

- **Lists**: To store student data, including student names and grades.
- **Sets**: To store unique subjects across all students.
- **Dictionaries**: To map student names to their grades for quick access.
- **Tuples**: To store student grade pairs (subject, grade) as immutable collections.
